- [x] Interactive CLI mode

## 🔥 High Impact Additions (Easy to Implement)

### 1. **Push Notification System** ✅ ADDED
- `notification_system.py` - Mock API for push notifications
- Workout reminders (1 hour before)
- Meal time alerts with protein targets
- PR attempt alerts when recovery is optimal
- Rest day recommendations when overtraining detected
- Motivational quotes throughout the day
- Milestone celebrations (225 bench, 315 squat, etc.)

**Demo Value**: Shows real-world app functionality

### 2. **Enhanced ReAct Loop with Feedback** ✅ ADDED
- `react_loop.py` - Multi-iteration agent reasoning
- Simulates user feedback on plans
- Agents re-evaluate and adjust based on feedback
- Shows 3 iterations of refinement
- Demonstrates adaptive AI behavior

**Demo Value**: Shows sophisticated multi-agent collaboration

### 3. **Workout Analytics Dashboard**
Create visual charts showing:
- Strength progression over time
- Volume trends (sets × reps × weight)
- Recovery score tracking
- Body weight changes
- Protein intake consistency

**Implementation**:
```python
# Use matplotlib or plotly
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd

def plot_strength_progression(workout_history):
    dates = [w['date'] for w in workout_history]
    bench = [w['lifts']['bench_press'] for w in workout_history]

    plt.plot(dates, bench, marker='o')
    plt.title('Bench Press Progression')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Weight (lbs)')
    plt.show()
```

**Demo Value**: Visual proof of progress

### 4. **Exercise Form Video Analysis**
- Upload form check videos (if API supports video)
- Frame-by-frame analysis of squat depth, bar path, etc.
- Generate correction cues

**Implementation**: Use vision model on video frames

### 5. **Social Features (Mock)**
- Leaderboards (compare your lifts to others)
- Virtual training partners
- Achievement sharing
- Challenge friends to lift battles

**Demo Value**: Shows scalability thinking

### 6. **Voice Command Integration (Mock)**
- "Hey FocusFlow, log my bench press: 225 x 5"
- "What's my workout today?"
- Text-to-speech responses from Coach Agent

**Implementation**:
```python
import speech_recognition as sr
from gtts import gTTS

def voice_command():
    r = sr.Recognizer()
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        audio = r.listen(source)
        command = r.recognize_google(audio)
        return command
```

### 7. **Injury Prevention AI**
- Analyze training volume and flag overtraining risk
- Suggest deload weeks
- Identify muscle imbalances from lift data
- Recovery protocol recommendations

**Implementation**: Rule-based system + LLM insights

### 8. **Meal Prep Assistant with Vision**
- Photo your meals → AI estimates macros
- Meal prep planning for the week
- Shopping list generation
- Recipe suggestions based on macros

**Demo Value**: Full-stack fitness solution

### 9. **Gym Buddy Finder (Mock)**
- Match with users with similar goals
- Find nearby training partners
- Group workout challenges

**Demo Value**: Community/social features

### 10. **Wearable Integration (Mock API)**
Simulate data from:
- Apple Watch / Fitbit / Whoop
- Heart rate during workouts
- Sleep tracking data
- Step count and NEAT

**Implementation**:
```python
class MockWearable:
    def get_heart_rate(self):
        return random.randint(60, 180)

    def get_sleep_data(self):
        return {
            'deep_sleep': 2.5,
            'rem_sleep': 1.8,
            'light_sleep': 3.2,
            'total': 7.5
        }
```

## 🎯 ReAct Loop Enhancements

### Current: Single Pass
```
User Data → Insight → Plan → Coach → Done
```

### Enhanced: Multi-Loop with Feedback
```
Iteration 1:
User Data → Insight → Plan → Coach → User Feedback → Adjust

Iteration 2:
Adjusted Data → Insight → Refined Plan → Coach → Feedback → Approve/Adjust

Iteration 3:
Final Plan → Notifications → Execute
```

### Specific Feedback Scenarios
1. **User says: "Too hard"**
   - Agents reduce volume by 20%
   - Lower intensity recommendations
   - Add more rest days

2. **User says: "Too easy"**
   - Increase weight recommendations
   - Add volume (extra sets)
   - Reduce rest periods

3. **User says: "Not enough chest work"**
   - Planner adds chest exercises
   - Insight explains why
   - Coach motivates for chest gains

4. **User says: "I'm injured"**
   - Switch to alternative exercises
   - Focus on uninjured areas
   - Recovery protocol
