# Fixes Applied - Streamlit 404 Error Resolution

## Issue
When clicking "Generate New Weekly Plan" in Streamlit, all three agents returned 404 errors:
```
⚠️ API Error: 404 Client Error: Not Found for url: https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions
```

## Root Cause
1. Agents were using incorrect model names:
   - Primary: `nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-instruct`
   - Fallback: `nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct`
2. Both models don't exist or aren't accessible with the API key
3. Unnecessary fallback logic causing additional failures

## Solution Applied

### 1. Updated All Agents (insight.py, planner.py, coach.py)

**Changed model to correct version:**
```python
# Before:
model = os.getenv("INSIGHT_MODEL", "nvidia/nemotron-4-340b-instruct")
fallback_model = os.getenv("FALLBACK_MODEL", "nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct")

# After:
model = "nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
endpoint = "https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1"
```

**Removed fallback logic:**
- Simplified error handling to return errors directly
- No more trying non-existent fallback models
- Cleaner, more predictable behavior

### 2. Fixed Streamlit Integration (fitness_tracker.py)

**Updated generate_workout_plan() with proper user_data:**
```python
user_data = {
    "user_id": "streamlit_user",
    "workout_done": False,
    "workout_type": "planning",
    "max_lifts": {
        "bench_press": 135,
        "squat": 185,
        "deadlift": 225,
        "overhead_press": 95
    },
    "recent_lifts": {},
    "protein_grams": 120,
    "calories": 2200,
    "sleep_hours": 7,
    "water_oz": 70,
    "soreness": 3,
    "energy": "moderate",
    "body_weight": profile['weight'] * 2.2
}
```

## Verification

### Test Results (All Passed ✅):

## Files Modified

1. `agents/insight.py` - Model name and error handling
2. `agents/planner.py` - Model name and error handling
3. `agents/coach.py` - Model name and error handling
4. `fitness_tracker.py` - User data structure in generate_workout_plan()
